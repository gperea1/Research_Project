Abstractâ€”As the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources like wind and solar PV deepen, we will begin to see increased challenges for the grid. In this paper, we explore the effect of bidirectional EV charging on the energy balance on the grid. We first create a simplified 3-bus grid model with a similar resource profile to the grid that CAISO operates. We then optimize the bi-directional EV charging with high EV penetration to determine the amount of ramping needed when we electrify a high percentage of vehicles. We end up with a model that shows a 3-fold economic advantage for EV drivers who choose to discharge in the evening peak hours. We also determine charging/discharging behavior that both maximizes the profits for drivers while reducing the need for fossil fuel peaking plants.


III. METHODOLOGY

We begin our modeling by creating a 3 bus transmission network. At each node we have solar production and loads that are all time dependent. We run the optimization for the 24 hours on one representative day on May 24, 2023. For our method, we also assumed to use Level 2 chargers where the maximum charging level is 6.6 kW and the maximum discharging is 3.3 kW. To compare how well EV bidirectional charging works in the grid, we created 2 cases. Case 0 is where we have no EVs and no storage in the system while in Case 1 we have have EVs and their parameters such as charging rate limits.
