Abstractâ€”As the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources like wind and solar PV deepen, we will begin to see increased challenges for the grid. In this paper, we explore the effect of bidirectional EV charging on the energy balance on the grid. We first create a simplified 3-bus grid model with a similar resource profile to the grid that CAISO operates. We then optimize the bi-directional EV charging with high EV penetration to determine the amount of ramping needed when we electrify a high percentage of vehicles. We end up with a model that shows a 3-fold economic advantage for EV drivers who choose to discharge in the evening peak hours. We also determine charging/discharging behavior that both maximizes the profits for drivers while reducing the need for fossil fuel peaking plants.
